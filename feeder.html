		</div>
	    <p>Part of the Woodwind group of musical instruments, the Flute produces sound via the flow of air across an opening. Flutes are among the earliest musical instruments in existence, dating back tens of thousands of years ago. Flute players are commonly known as flutists. Styles of Flute vary all over the world, from Indian to Chinese, Western-transverse (modern-day) and Pre-Inca. Designs can vary from simple tubes which air is blown into all the way to metal-fashioned "aerophones" with complex inner workings.</p>

		<h2>The Harp</h2>

		</div>
	    <p>The Harp is a stringed-class music instrument, comprised of individual strings that run at an angle across the soundboard where sound is produced via plugs with the Harpists' fingers. Harps are known across the world and date back to the early thousands BC. Harps can also vary in size, from ones that can be played in your lap to larger solid-wood harps that require a base or "foot" to rest on a flat surface. A Harps main parts consist of the neck, resonator and strings.</p>

		</div>
	    <p>Saxophones are part of the brass-family of woodwind instruments, similar to the clarinet only in that both have holes atop the neck which the player blows air into and closes via key-mechanisms. Saxophones date back to the mid 1800s, and are commonly used in everything from military application to orchestral performances thanks to their various series which determine their use.

		</div>
	    <p>The Trumpet family is part of the brass family of musical instruments. Containing the highest sound-register in the brass family, Trumpets date back to around 1000BC however only started to be used as a musical instrument in the late 14th century, after previously only being used as a "signal" for battles or other events. Trumpets are played by Trumpeters, who blow air through their lips into the tubing, producing a "buzzing" sound which translates to vibrations in the air-columns. A Trumpeter can then press down on valves or pistons, which increase the length the vibrations have to travel before exiting, resulting in varying pitches.</p>

		<h2>Violin</h2>
		<div class="">

Violins are played by retracting and extending a bow across its 4 strings which are drawn across its the soundboard or belly, however can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers. Violins are prominent in a wide variety of music, from western music to classical, folk music and indian music. Violins date back to the 16th century, with its homage being to Italy. It served as the base for many, if not most stringed instruments used today. A Violin player is called a Violinist.</p>
