	<h1>Website Planning</h1>

	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>The client's main goal is for the promotion of the organisation and; in summary, hopes for increased attendance to the organisations events. The need for a new site has been brought to attention due to the out-dated and aged look of the existing site.</p>

	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
	<p>To evaluate the successful implementation of an updated website, we would be required to look at the quantitive data in terms of increased memberships and attendance rates as well as being able to take qualitative data into consideration from feedback via either supporters or performers. </p>

	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>Generally the target audience is very broad and will be designed to attract people of all ages, which is generally ages 13+. It is also designed to make orchestra look very appealing to as many people as possible. However there are two kinds of individuals that this site needs to attract:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Performers, such as conductors from around the country, and students willing to participate playing an instrument.</li>
		<li>Audiences, such There can be up to 5,000 individuals who attend  concerts.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Organized Content</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Home -- The current Orchestra home page is too cluttered. We'll endeavour to combine current elements with an events calender, social media events feed, etc.</li>
		<li>About Us/Support Us -- Summarized information on the orchestra, including combining the current seperate support us pages and about us</li>
		<li>Contact Us -- Moving the contact information that's duplicated on the home page to here, de-cluttering the main page.</li>
		<li>Concerts/Repertoire -- Combining these (currently) seperate pages into one. "2017 debut concert by the bandnamehere" for example.</li>
		<li>Upcoming events/Facebook events feed/Announcements -- With this we're aiming to integrate the social media aspect for the client.</li>
	</ul>
