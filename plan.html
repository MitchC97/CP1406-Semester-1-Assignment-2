	<h1>Website Planning</h1>

	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>The client wants people to know about their orchestra, to become involved, attend its concerts with increased audiences, and membership aspects with feedback.</p>

	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
	<p>As membership is considered an important aspect of the site, an increase of memberships would be one of the aspects that directly correlates to successful website design. </p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The client's main goal is for the promotion of the organisation and; in summary, hopes for increased attendance to the organisations events. The need for a new site has been brought to attention due to the out-dated and ages look of the existing site.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate the successful implementation of an updated website, we would be required to look at the quantitive data in terms of increased memberships and attendance rates as well as being able to take qualitative data into consideration from feedback via either supporters or performers. </p>
=======
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>Generally the target audience is very broad and will be designed to attract people of all ages, which is generally ages 13+. It is also designed to make orchestra look very appealing to as many people as possible. However there are two kinds of individuals that this site needs to attract:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Performers, such as conductors from around the country, and students willing to participate playing an instrument.</li>
		<li>Audiences, such There can be up to 5,000 individuals who attend  concerts.</li>
	</ul>
