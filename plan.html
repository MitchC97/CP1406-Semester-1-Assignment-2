<h1>Website Planning</h1>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The client's main goal is for the promotion of the organisation and; in summary, hopes for increased attendance to the organisations events. The need for a new site has been brought to attention due to the out-dated and ages look of the existing site.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate the successful implementation of an updated website, we would be required to look at the quantitive data in terms of increased memberships and attendance rates as well as being able to take qualitative data into consideration from feedback via either supporters or performers. </p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
