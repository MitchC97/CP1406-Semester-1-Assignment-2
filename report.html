<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>We went through the site and clicked everything to make sure it worked. Different web browsers, we tested in each website, chrome, firefox, safari. Also tested on multiple mobile devices, a few problems but we ran out of time to fix the problems. We tested turning off javascript and it somewhat functioned. More testing was required but our time has been limited.</p>

<h2>PMI</h2>

<p><strong>Pluses: </strong><br>
Working with different people who are used to doing web programming differently to eachother resulting in the combination of a variety of techniques which greatly benefits our assignment as it make it unique. Was also a great group experience, gaining experience working in a group.

</p>

<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> ...<br>
Our group members are not all available at the same time as some participants had other priorities such as work, which made it quite difficult to work as a team. Different team members doing different things at the same time was challenging. Takes a lot of time to communicate who is doing what.
</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong><br>
It brought together different work processes which had it's pros and cons but we worked through it.
